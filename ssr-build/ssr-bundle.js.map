Here's how it works:\n * Two things go into parsing: a regex to match with and an extractor to take apart the groups in the match.\n * An extractor is just a function that takes a regex match array and returns a { year: ..., month: ... } object\n * parse() does the work of executing the regex and applying the extractor. It takes multiple regex/extractor pairs to try in sequence.\n * Extractors can take a \"cursor\" representing the offset in the match to look at. This makes it easy to combine extractors.\n * combineExtractors() does the work of combining them, keeping track of the cursor through multiple extractions.\n * Some extractions are super dumb and simpleParse and fromStrings help DRY them.\n */\n\nfunction combineRegexes(...regexes) {\n  const full = regexes.reduce((f, r) => f + r.source, \"\");\n  return RegExp(`^${full}$`);\n}\n\nfunction combineExtractors(...extractors) {\n  return m =>\n    extractors\n      .reduce(\n        ([mergedVals, mergedZone, cursor], ex) => {\n          const [val, zone, next] = ex(m, cursor);\n          return [Object.assign(mergedVals, val), mergedZone || zone, next];\n        },\n        [{}, null, 1]\n      )\n      .slice(0, 2);\n}\n\nfunction parse(s, ...patterns) {\n  if (s == null) {\n    return [null, null];\n  }\n\n  for (const [regex, extractor] of patterns) {\n    const m = regex.exec(s);\n    if (m) {\n      return extractor(m);\n    }\n  }\n  return [null, null];\n}\n\nfunction simpleParse(...keys) {\n  return (match, cursor) => {\n    const ret = {};\n    let i;\n\n    for (i = 0; i < keys.length; i++) {\n      ret[keys[i]] = parseInteger(match[cursor + i]);\n    }\n    return [ret, null, cursor + i];\n  };\n}\n\n// ISO and SQL parsing\nconst offsetRegex = /(?:(Z)|([+-]\\d\\d)(?::?(\\d\\d))?)/,\n  isoTimeBaseRegex = /(\\d\\d)(?::?(\\d\\d)(?::?(\\d\\d)(?:[.,](\\d{1,30}))?)?)?/,\n  isoTimeRegex = RegExp(`${isoTimeBaseRegex.source}${offsetRegex.source}?`),\n  isoTimeExtensionRegex = RegExp(`(?:T${isoTimeRegex.source})?`),\n  isoYmdRegex = /([+-]\\d{6}|\\d{4})(?:-?(\\d\\d)(?:-?(\\d\\d))?)?/,\n  isoWeekRegex = /(\\d{4})-?W(\\d\\d)(?:-?(\\d))?/,\n  isoOrdinalRegex = /(\\d{4})-?(\\d{3})/,\n  extractISOWeekData = simpleParse(\"weekYear\", \"weekNumber\", \"weekDay\"),\n  extractISOOrdinalData = simpleParse(\"year\", \"ordinal\"),\n  sqlYmdRegex = /(\\d{4})-(\\d\\d)-(\\d\\d)/, // dumbed-down version of the ISO one\n  sqlTimeRegex = RegExp(\n    `${isoTimeBaseRegex.source} ?(?:${offsetRegex.source}|(${ianaRegex.source}))?`\n  ),\n  sqlTimeExtensionRegex = RegExp(`(?: ${sqlTimeRegex.source})?`);\n\nfunction int(match, pos, fallback) {\n  const m = match[pos];\n  return isUndefined(m) ? fallback : parseInteger(m);\n}\n\nfunction extractISOYmd(match, cursor) {\n  const item = {\n    year: int(match, cursor),\n    month: int(match, cursor + 1, 1),\n    day: int(match, cursor + 2, 1)\n  };\n\n  return [item, null, cursor + 3];\n}\n\nfunction extractISOTime(match, cursor) {\n  const item = {\n    hours: int(match, cursor, 0),\n    minutes: int(match, cursor + 1, 0),\n    seconds: int(match, cursor + 2, 0),\n    milliseconds: parseMillis(match[cursor + 3])\n  };\n\n  return [item, null, cursor + 4];\n}\n\nfunction extractISOOffset(match, cursor) {\n  const local = !match[cursor] && !match[cursor + 1],\n    fullOffset = signedOffset(match[cursor + 1], match[cursor + 2]),\n    zone = local ? null : FixedOffsetZone.instance(fullOffset);\n  return [{}, zone, cursor + 3];\n}\n\nfunction extractIANAZone(match, cursor) {\n  const zone = match[cursor] ?

It contains class and instance methods for creating, parsing, interrogating, transforming, and formatting them.\n *\n * A DateTime comprises of:\n * * A timestamp. Each DateTime instance refers to a specific millisecond of the Unix epoch.\n * * A time zone. Each instance is considered in the context of a specific zone (by default the local system's zone).\n * * Configuration properties that effect how output strings are formatted, such as `locale`, `numberingSystem`, and `outputCalendar`.\n *\n * Here is a brief overview of the most commonly used functionality it provides:\n *\n * * **Creation**: To create a DateTime from its components, use one of its factory class methods: {@link local}, {@link utc}, and (most flexibly) {@link fromObject}. To create one from a standard string format, use {@link fromISO}, {@link fromHTTP}, and {@link fromRFC2822}. To create one from a custom string format, use {@link fromFormat}. To create one from a native JS date, use {@link fromJSDate}.\n * * **Gregorian calendar and time**: To examine the Gregorian properties of a DateTime individually (i.e as opposed to collectively through {@link toObject}), use the {@link year}, {@link month},\n * {@link day}, {@link hour}, {@link minute}, {@link second}, {@link millisecond} accessors.\n * * **Week calendar**: For ISO week calendar attributes, see the {@link weekYear}, {@link weekNumber}, and {@link weekday} accessors.\n * * **Configuration** See the {@link locale} and {@link numberingSystem} accessors.\n * * **Transformation**: To transform the DateTime into other DateTimes, use {@link set}, {@link reconfigure}, {@link setZone}, {@link setLocale}, {@link plus}, {@link minus}, {@link endOf}, {@link startOf}, {@link toUTC}, and {@link toLocal}.\n * * **Output**: To convert the DateTime to other representations, use the {@link toRelative}, {@link toRelativeCalendar}, {@link toJSON}, {@link toISO}, {@link toHTTP}, {@link toObject}, {@link toRFC2822}, {@link toString}, {@link toLocaleString}, {@link toFormat}, {@link toMillis} and {@link toJSDate}.\n *\n * There's plenty others documented below.
